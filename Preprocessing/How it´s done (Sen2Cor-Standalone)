First of all you need a image that you want to preprocess.

You can do that by using R.

Once you have your Image downloaded it is a Zip-File which needs to be extracted to a place where it is easily accesible.
If you use too many subfolders it can cause some trouble. (I prefer Desktop)

Once you have the image in a regular folder you will need the Sen2Cor application which is based on Python.
So make sure that you have Python installed correctly, and that the system enviroment variable is set to the correct path of your python
installation.

Standalone installers:
Windows installer: http://step.esa.int/thirdparties/sen2cor/2.5.5/Sen2Cor-02.05.05-win64.zip
Linux installer: http://step.esa.int/thirdparties/sen2cor/2.5.5/Sen2Cor-02.05.05-Linux64.run
Mac installer: http://step.esa.int/thirdparties/sen2cor/2.5.5/Sen2Cor-02.05.05-Darwin64.run

Download the installer that fits your OS. I only did it with Windows.

On Windows:

Extract the downloaded Zip-Folder.

Open up CMD. And navigate to your Sen2Cor folder. e.g. cd C:\Users\Benny\Sen2Cor-02.05.05-win64

Then you type in: L2A_Process.bat --help

It should show: C:\Users\Benny\Sen2Cor-02.05.05-win64>L2A_Process.bat --help
usage: L2A_Process.py [-h] [--resolution {10,20,60}] [--sc_only] [--cr_only]

Sentinel-2 Level 2A Processor (Sen2Cor). Version: 2.5.5, created: 2018.03.19,
supporting Level-1C product version <= 14.5.

positional arguments:
  directory             Directory where the Level-1C input files are located

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --resolution {10,20,60}
                        Target resolution, can be 10, 20 or 60m. If omitted,
                        all resolutions will be processed
  --sc_only             Performs only the scene classification at 60 or 20m
                        resolution
  --cr_only             Performs only the creation of the L2A product tree, no
                        processing
  --refresh             Performs a refresh of the persistent configuration
                        before start
  --GIP_L2A GIP_L2A     Select the user GIPP
  --GIP_L2A_SC GIP_L2A_SC
                        Select the scene classification GIPP
  --GIP_L2A_AC GIP_L2A_AC
                        Select the atmospheric correction GIPP
  --GIP_L2A_PB GIP_L2A_PB
                        Select the processing baseline GIPP
                        
If you get to this point you should be ready to use the Sen2Cor preprocessing:

Get the Adress of your Imagefolder e.g: D:\S2A_MSIL1C_20161030T081042_N0204_R078_T37SDU_20161030T081834.SAFE

Type in the CMD (still in your Sen2Cor Folder): L2A_Process.bat D:\S2A_MSIL1C_20161030T081042_N0204_R078_T37SDU_20161030T081834.SAFE

This shall start the process. It is important to know that we want the best achievable resolution, which in case of sentinel 2 is 10. 
To get there we have to start the process like shown above, which will also preprocess in the 60 and 20 resolution. 
Those are needed for the 10m process.
If you ever want a lower resolution you can type --resolutuion 60, or --resolution 20 before your path.
Example: L2A_Process.bat --resolution 60 D:\S2A_MSIL1C_20161030T081042_N0204_R078_T37SDU_20161030T081834.SAFE
If you type --resolution 10 the process will stop at 30%.
