A really useful program that i found is SNAP.
It can be used to take a closer look at the Sentinel2Data and to watch the images.
Another useful thing about SNAP is that it has a Sen2Cor Plugin which can be started inside the programm and the output
file is immediately shown inside SNAP.

Installation:

Windows 64bit: http://step.esa.int/downloads/6.0/installers/esa-snap_all_windows-x64_6_0.exe
Windows 32Bit: http://step.esa.int/downloads/6.0/installers/esa-snap_all_windows_6_0.exe
Mac: http://step.esa.int/downloads/6.0/installers/esa-snap_all_macos_6_0.dmg
Unix 64-bit: http://step.esa.int/downloads/6.0/installers/esa-snap_all_unix_6_0.sh

Install SNAP and open it up.

On the top left you can open a new file.
Navigate to your extracted Sentinel2 Image folder open it and then you want to open the MTD file on the Bottom
It is usually called something like MTD_MSIL1C
This will grant you access to the whole image and its data.

Create and image

Now you want to rightclick on the file and select "create rgb image". it will take some time but it will open up
the image.

Install Sen2Cor Plugin.
This one can be quite tricky sometimes.

Open SNAP
In the top bar you will find Tools > Plugins
First of all check for updates and install them. 
(If the update part is not working contact me and i will provide you the ways to get it working)
Next go to Available Plugins and install the Sen2Cor processor.
Restart Snap.
Open up the desired file and create an RGB image.
Next go for tools > "manage external tools".
Sen2Cor should show up but the status should say an "!"
Select the file that you want and klick on run
This should lead you to the next window .
select processing parameters and check the "display execution output" box.
Click on "Run" on the bottom.
It should tell you that something is missing or needed, i dont really remember. But just accept whatever the programm wants.
After a few restarts it should work. 
Now you can preprocess the images in SNAP.
Once the programm finished the output file should be shown on the left.
