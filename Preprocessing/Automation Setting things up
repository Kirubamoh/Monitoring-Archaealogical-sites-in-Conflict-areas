So the automation is up and running and here i will show you how it´s done.

First of all you need Python to be installed and make sure that you have Python installed correctly, and that the system enviroment 
variable is set to the correct path of your python installation.

Next on you will need the right GDAL Package for your Python setup

Open up your CMD and type in: python
it will show something along the lines of:Python 3.7.1 (v3.7.1:260ec2c36a, Oct 20 2018, 14:57:15) [MSC v.1915 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32
The Python and the Bit Versions are important for the next steps. In the top example it would be "3.7" and "AMD64"

With these infos go to https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#gdal and search for the file that is fitting your Python
Example: For me it would be GDAL‑2.3.2‑cp37‑cp37m‑win_amd64.whl because i use Python 3.7 with an 64bit architecture.

Now you will open up the cmd again and navigate to folder where the newly downloaded file is e.g. "cd C:\Users\Benny\Desktop   
and type in "python -m pip install GDAL-[etc.].whl"

If everything worked you can open up a new cmd window, type in python press enter and try "import gdal"
IMPORTANT: It can happen that there is an error which says something about an "ogr" file(i dont really remember correctly) 
just type "import gdal" in again and it should work. 
you can then head to your gdal file  which is normally installed in your programms folder. navigate to gdal_plugins and delete that 
"ogr" file. 

Now make sure that Sen2Cor is installed correctly. I provided instructions for that here:
https://github.com/Kirubamoh/Monitoring-Archaealogical-sites-in-Conflict-areas/blob/master/Preprocessing/How%20it%C2%B4s%20done%20(Sen2Cor-Standalone)

Next on you will need to download the scripts. You will find them here on Github in the Preprocessing folder and its called get-sen-2-py-mast.rar
