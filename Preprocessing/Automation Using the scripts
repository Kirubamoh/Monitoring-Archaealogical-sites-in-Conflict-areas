So first of all the most important things are hardcoded in the scripts like timerange, relative orbitnumber, etc. 
To change that you will need to open up the "download_sentinel2" file with either an editor or for example VSC

In here you can change the variables:
tiles = ['37SDU']

query_kwargs = {
			'platformname': 'Sentinel-2',
			'producttype': 'S2MSI1C',
			'relativeorbitnumber': '078',
			'date': ('20180301', '20180310')
			}
      
      The tiles and the relativeorbitnumber are already set to palmyra. just the date should be edited.
      the format is (YYYYMMDD)
      
      If you change something just make sure that you save your changes.
      
      Now you want to make sure that the location of the L2A_Process file in your Sen2Cor folder is set as a path in your 
      enviromental variables. (sometimes it also works to put the sen2cor folder inside the script folder)    
      
      To run the scripts open up the cmd navigate to the script folder and type in (without quotes)
      "python download_and_preprocessing.py downloadfolder username password"
      the downloadfolder can be in the format of C:/Users/Username/Desktop and the username and password refers to your
      esa login.
      
      Hit enter and the download, unzipping, and the preprocessing should start
