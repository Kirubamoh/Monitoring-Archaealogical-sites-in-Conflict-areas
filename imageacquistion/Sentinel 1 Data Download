Here you will find the instructions for downloading Sentinel1 Data with R

First of all load in the following packages
library(sf)
library(sp)
library(raster)
library(mapview)
library(mapedit)

Then load in 
library(getSpatialData)

Next you will need do declare the aoi by typing in

drwn = drawFeatures()
mapview(drwn)
aoi <- drwn$geometry

This will open up a window on the right side where you can select the aoi by hand. Font forget to click the "done" button on the
bottom right

Now you need to declare your username and password for esa

username = "username"
password = "password"

Then type in:
query <- getSentinel_query(time_range = c("2018-10-01", "2018-11-01"), aoi = aoi, platform = "Sentinel-1", username = username, password = password)
You can change the timerange right here its in (YYYYMMDD) format ^

After that you can take a look at the result by typing in: 
View(query)

A list of files will show up.
The best Files for us to use are GRDH files.
They are called something like S1A_IW_GRDH_1SDV_20180302T152448_20180302T152513_020838_023BBE_083B

Look for the one with a date that you want scroll to the left and memorize the number of the table listing.

if you want to download the e.g. 7th file you need to type in:
getSentinel_data(records = query[7,],dir_out = "D:/Sattelitendaten/Sentinel1", username = username, password = password,)
the dir_out = "fsdfsdffdf" part declares the folder where the image is downloaded to.

Hit enter and the download should start
